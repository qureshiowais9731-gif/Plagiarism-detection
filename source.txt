Embedded systems have existed even before the IT revolution, originally built using old vacuum tube
and transistor technologies with low-level programming. Advances in semiconductor and
nanotechnology, along with the IT revolution, led to the development of modern miniature
embedded systems. The first recognized modern embedded system was the Apollo Guidance
Computer (AGO), developed by MIT for the lunar expedition. It controlled the inertial guidance
systems of both the Command Module (CM) and the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM). The AGC had
limited memory and processing power, utilizing approximately 5,000 ICs and a clock frequency of
1.024 MHz. The user interface, called DSKY, resembled a calculator keypad. The first mass-produced
embedded system was the guidance computer for the Minuteman-I missile in 1961, built using
discrete transistor logic and a hard disk for memory. Early integrated circuits, first produced in 1958,
were also used in these embedded systems, notably by NASA and the US military.
